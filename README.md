### TxWaitTime

This process monitors the bitcoin network and records features of bitcoin transactions as they enter the memory pool of my bitcoin node.
All of the collected data is inserted into a postgresql database for further processing.
Initially this started out as an idea to generate real time information about bitcoin transactions.
Currently it is just a way to record the fees bitcoin transactions are offering miners for entry into their blocks.
